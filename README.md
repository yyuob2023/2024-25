# Fintech Enrichment (FTE) 2024-25

This is the github repository for Fintech Enrichment sessions of the academic year 2024-25. The repository will hold all related materials and is supposed to be updated after each session. 
FTE sessions are non-assessed, in-person (face to face), and not mandatory sessions that provide additional useful information and knowledge, not included in the Fintech programmes. Due to the nature of the unit, the sessions are designed to be as independent from each other as possible, so that you can attend the ones you think might be most useful to you. The sessions will introduce tools that might be useful in your core units such as project planning, report writing and presentations. 

* Part of the materials used in the sessions are based on the DSE2023-24 which are developed by Mr. Theo Constantinides, Dr. Dalila Avdic, Dr. Sebastien Rochat, Dr. Efi Psomopoulou, and Miss Gaby Miles.  There will also be guest lecturers from industrial partners during TB2.
